# Heart-Failure-Mortality-Prediction-2015-

## ABSTRACT

Applied cardiac health data in order to analyze and establish trends of various health factors for machine algorithms to utilize to predict chances of death from heart failure. 

## Purpose 

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world. If we can apply the risks for a cardiac event into a machine algorithm, it may be benificial to predict the likely hood of a future event and take preventaive measures to reduce the risks.

## Summary

1. Heart failure death is more likely to occur >60 year olds
2. Men are higher risk than women.
3. Excellent and reliable qualifiers to predict heart failure mortality:
EF, Serum Creatinine
4. Good qualifiers:
Age,  Serum Sodium, HTN, Anemia, Sex, CPK
5. Decent qualifiers: 
Positive Smoking History, Diabetes
